The Grit Scale measures the extent to which individuals can maintain focus and interest and persevere in obtaining long-term goals, a key element of technical aptitude. The assessment serves up a series of statements that would prompt the end user to respond using a 5-point Likert-type scale. The responses to each statement are associated with a numeric grit score. Once all questions are answered, the individual response scores are compiled and divided by the number of statements to deliver an average Grit score. The Grit Scale typically deployed in an employement setting to determine perserverance.
